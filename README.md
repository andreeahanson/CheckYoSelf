## CHECK YO'SELF 

### Description

Check Yo'Self is a web app that helps users keep organized by writing task lists, that they can keep track of by checking off tasks, marking their note-cards urgent, deleting them, and creating new ones.

### Functionality

On top of the page there is a search bar with an input field and a search button, that filters the cards by title.
On the left side of the page there are 2 more inputs: one for the title of the note-card and the second one for the things to do. There are 4 buttons in that area:

1. Make Task List Button - creates a card containing the content that the user just created
2. Clear All Button - empties all the fields on the left side of the screen
3. Filter By Urgency - filters existing cards by urgency

On the main side of the page is where the cards are being created. A "greeting" message appears whenever the card field is empty, and dissapears whenever a new card is added.
